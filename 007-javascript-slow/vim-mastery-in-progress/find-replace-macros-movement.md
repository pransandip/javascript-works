### There are tons of vim tutorials out there
They all go over the basics, but i wanted to do something different.

I want to talk about some tricks and strategy i take when vimming hard.  This
strategy guide is meant to help you up the game HARD on your vimming.  Go from
someone who can get things done, do just crushing.

### A Note about vimming in general
There are two general branches of vimming.

1. The Chess Player
1. The Primeagen

The chess player thinks about the movements, what is the most bestest move here?

Vim Golfs always.  Now to each their own honestly.  But for me that is too much
overhead.

For me, I don't want analysis paralysis, but I always want to explore and find
out if there is a better way

###  So if you are looking for a tutorial...
that uses the most arcane moves to shave your 20 strokes to 19 this aint it.

But if you want repeatable, fast, motions that will make editing out of this
world fun and you will become, "blazingly" fast, then this is the series, oh
yes, I said series, for you


### So I think one of the most valuable things you need to get out of vim
is to stop thinking you need multiple cursors

I know, this is a hot one.  People get real fired up over this.  We talking,
REAL fired up.

Just to put it out there, I think multiple cursors is an anti-pattern.

** wtf? **

The reason why i say that is because they are not as powerful as find and
replace or macros.  Simply better than vertical edit in most cases
